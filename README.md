To maintain a competitive edge, today’s organizations must gain practical knowledge of data science, machine learning and artificial
intelligence. Careers especially in engineering, data science, and technical management depend on the immense value of those advanced
analytical and programming skills.
In the Data Science & Machine Learning program from zero to hero program, an executive education program led by the Big Bang Data, you
will dive deep into learning the applied mathematical structure of core machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. The course
focuses on the skills needed to work efficiently with machine learning models, such classification models, regression models, clustering
models, and optimization.
